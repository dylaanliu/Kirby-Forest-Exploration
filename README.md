# Kirbyâ€™s Forest Exploration

Grade 11 Python game summative project

Requires Pygame to run

A small game I made in Grade 11 for my summative project.

You plays as kirby and the goal is to stay alive as long as possible. You will have a total of three lives. Enemies will come from the left and right side of the screen and you will have to either dodge the enemies or kill them by attacking. The longer you survive the more points you get!
